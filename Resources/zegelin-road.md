The Zegelin family was one of the larger pioneering families in the Rochester area of Northern Victoria and the family eventually had a road named after them. There are currently two Zegelin roads, one at Fairy Dell near Rochester which is 6 km long and the other leading to the Waranga Basin Reservoir that is nearly 9 km long.

*It's possible that the road was once continuous, which would have made it over 50km long, however I have no evidence of that. If anyone has some info that they would like to share, then you can email me - thanks! Peter*
